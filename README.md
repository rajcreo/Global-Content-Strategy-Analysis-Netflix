This project looks at Netflix data to learn about what shows and movies people like and when they watch them. We're using Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to study trends in making movies and TV shows, what viewers like, and when Netflix releases them. We're looking at things like what kinds of shows are popular, when they're released, and what people like in different parts of the world. The goal is to give creators and Netflix a better idea of what to make and when to release it.\

**Business Problem:**\
Analyze the data and generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries.\

**Insights & Recommendations:**\
1. Between 2016 and 2019, there was a significant rise in the total number of movies and TV shows. However, after 2019, there was a sharp decline in the production of both types of content. One possible explanation for this decline is the global pandemic caused by COVID-19. During this time, restrictions and challenges related to the pandemic may have limited the opportunities for creating new content, resulting in a decrease in production.
2. From 2015 onwards, the United States has experienced a notable surge in the total number of TV shows compared to other leading countries.
3. As time has passed, there has been an observable trend of movies having longer average durations compared to previous years. This indicates that movies nowadays tend to be longer in length. But, when it comes to TV shows, there has been a slight decrease in the average number of seasons. This suggests that TV shows are more inclined to have a lower number of seasons on average than they did in the past. This could be attributed to various factors, including the possibility that recent TV shows have failed to capture the attention of the audience, resulting in fewer seasons being produced.
4. The majority of movies have a duration ranging from 100 to 125 minutes, suggesting that this range is considered optimal. Similarly, many TV shows consist of only one season, and the total number of TV shows gradually declines as the number of seasons increases. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that many TV shows fail to resonate with audiences, leading creators to avoid producing additional seasons. Additionally, as TV shows progress through multiple seasons, there is often a decline in quality, resulting in decreased viewership. Consequently, producers may choose to discontinue the series altogether.
5. In the top five countries, excluding India, Friday is considered the optimal day to release movies on Netflix. However, in India, Thursday is slightly better than Friday for movie releases. On the other hand, when it comes to TV shows, Friday remains the best day to add them to Netflix.
6. In the top five countries, a significant number of movies were added to Netflix during the months of November, December, and January. These months correspond to the winter season, suggesting that audiences have a preference for watching movies during this time. Thus, the winter season can be considered the best season to list movies on Netflix in these countries.\
On the other hand, in the top five countries, TV shows do not exhibit a clear seasonal pattern for their addition to Netflix. TV shows are added in different months in different country, indicating that there is no specific seasonality trend or preference when it comes to releasing TV shows on Netflix.
7. The average duration of movies in India is generally higher compared to other countries. This indicates that Indian audiences have a preference for longer movies.
8. The majority of movies listed on Netflix in India are international movies. This suggests that Indian audiences have a preference for watching international content on the platform. Furthermore, even within the category of international movies, the Indian audience tends to favor longer-duration films.
9. After 2019, there has been a decline in the overall number of movies in India. One potential reason for this decline in India could be attributed to a sudden shift in audience preferences towards web series and international TV shows. This change in viewers' interests might have led content creators and Netflix to focus more on producing and promoting web series and international TV shows rather than movies, resulting in a decline in the number of Indian movies added to the platform.
10. There is a higher likelihood of success for movies and TV shows when they are added to Netflix soon after their release, as evidenced by the larger number of titles available with a smaller date difference. This implies that a quick addition to the Netflix platform significantly increases the probability of achieving success for these movies and TV shows.
