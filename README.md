This project looks at Netflix data to learn about what shows and movies people like and when they watch them. We're using Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to study trends in making movies and TV shows, what viewers like, and when Netflix releases them. We're looking at things like what kinds of shows are popular, when they're released, and what people like in different parts of the world. The goal is to give creators and Netflix a better idea of what to make and when to release it.\
